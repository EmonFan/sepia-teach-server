# SEPIA Teach-Server

This server exposes the Teach-API to the framework and is responsible for adding new stuff to the assistant like custom answers and commands. It can also collect feedback to improve SEPIA.
Usually the Teach-API is accessed via a user-friendly, graphical interface inside one of the cross-platform-clients called Teach-UI.

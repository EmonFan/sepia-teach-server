# SEPIA Teach-Server
Part of the [SEPIA Framework](https://sepia-framework.github.io/)  

This server exposes the Teach-API to the framework and is responsible for adding new stuff to the assistant like custom answers and commands. It can also collect feedback to improve SEPIA.
Usually the Teach-API is accessed via a user-friendly, graphical interface inside one of the [cross-platform-clients](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-html-client-app) called Teach-UI.
